App Name: KADVA PATEL PERFECT MATCH
Last Updated: November 2025

At KADVA PATEL PERFECT MATCH, we have a zero-tolerance policy toward child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) in any form. Protecting children and maintaining a safe, respectful online environment is our highest priority.

Our Commitment

We strictly prohibit any content, message, or activity that exploits, endangers, or sexualizes minors (anyone under 18 years old).

We do not allow the creation, sharing, or promotion of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any related exploitative content.

We immediately report any suspected CSAE activity to appropriate law enforcement authorities and relevant child protection organizations, including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) or their regional equivalents.

We ensure our app fully complies with international CSAE prevention standards and Google Play’s Developer Program Policies.

Our moderation systems and review processes actively monitor and remove any harmful, illegal, or exploitative content.

Reporting Abuse

If you encounter any content or behavior that may involve child exploitation, please contact us immediately at:

All reports are reviewed urgently and handled in accordance with applicable laws and child protection requirements.
